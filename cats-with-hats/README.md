100 cats in a circle.

You put a hat on the cats without a hat, and you remove the hat from the cats that do not have one.

At the start no cat has a hat.

You go 100 times around.
- In the first round you give a hat to each cat.
- In the second round you remove the hat to every second cat.
- In the third round, you add or remove the hat to every third cat.
- And so on.

Which cats have a hat after 100 rounds?
