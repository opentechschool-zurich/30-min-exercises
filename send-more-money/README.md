# Send + More = Money

Replace each character by a digit: create a function that finds the replacements for a valid result.

`ale/calcolo_enigmatico.py` solves the variant published by the italian magazine _Settimana enigmistica`:

A specific example is:

```
 ab *  c =  ade
  *    *      *
 af *  b =   bg
----- ---------
ahg * ae = bede
```

But the calculations can have any of the four operators: +, -, *, /.
