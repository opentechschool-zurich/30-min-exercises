# Drinking Gazzosa

Young Guglielmo drinks lot of gazzosa. They cost 3.-- each.

The shop takes back the bottles and gives one free gazzosa for each three bottles returned.

How many gazzosa can Guglielmo buy with a given amount of money?

Example:

```py
count_gazzosa(3) == 1
count_gazzosa(9) == 4
count_gazzosa(30) == 14
```
